Handwritten Text Generation

A machine learning-powered application that converts typed text into handwritten-like script, mimicking human handwriting.

Overview

This project uses deep learning techniques to generate handwritten text from input typed text. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten samples and learns to replicate the unique characteristics of human handwriting.

Features

- Converts typed text into handwritten-like script
- Mimics human handwriting with varying styles and fonts
- Customizable output with adjustable font sizes and styles
- Potential applications in education, design, and accessibility

Technical Details

- Built using Python and TensorFlow
- Trained on a dataset of handwritten samples
- Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)

Usage

1. Install required dependencies
2. Run the application using Python
3. Input typed text to generate handwritten output

Future Development

- Expand dataset to include more handwriting styles and fonts
- Improve model accuracy and efficiency
- Explore applications in real-world scenarios
